# PPCompliance
This repository contains data for ASE 2022 accepted paper: Are they Toeing the Line? Diagnosing Privacy Violations among Browser Extensions

## Source Code
The source code of our diagnosing tool is consisted of two parts: trainning models and practice&policy analyzer.
```
./NLP_models
./PP_analyzer
```
Inside the `NLP_models`, we implemented three models, which are BiLSTM, BERT and SVM. And we trained and tested the models with three different dataset, Zimmeck, Liushuang and our PrivAud-100, which are all open sourced.
Inside the `PP_analyzer`, we implemented a privacy analyzer and a practice analyzer. The code is for large scale privacy issues analysis among all the chrome extensions.

## Fully Compliant and Incompliant Examples Report
The report gives two extension examples. One is the fully compliant example, whose privacy policy satisfies the minimum requirements and all the data collection statements are conform to each other among privacy policy, privacy practice summary and privacy practice. 
By contrast, another example is the fully incompliant example.
The details of these two example are located at:
```

```

## Data Set
#### Full List
The full list for all the extensions we crawled from the Chrome Web Store is located in:
```
./chrome_60k_fulllist.json
```
Meanwhile, we collected all possible meta data during the crawling, including the id, name, author, subcategory, downlaods, rating, introduction, last update time, privacy policy declared, and outside privacy policy link.

The sourcecode for each extension and corresponding privacy HTML file is located in Dropbox shared folder:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vq22x69pn5etl22/AAABcN9RYfcZSjPnlcdyMvRsa?dl=0
#### Extension Code
The source code for each extension is located in the directory:
```
[shared_folder]/source_code/[ext_id].crx
```
There are 64,114, extensions with source code, 66G, in total.
#### Privacy Policy Files
The raw HTML file for each linked privacy policy page is located in the directory:
```
[shared_folder]/policy_pages/[ext_id].html
```
There are 20,761 HTML files, 846M, in total.

#### PrivAud-100
The corpus, PrivAud-100, consists of 100 randomly selected privacy policies, 3,529 sentences with labels.
The data is located in:
```
./PrivAud-100.csv
```
The detail for each label is located in:
```
./PrivAud-100_labels.md
